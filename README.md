Welcome to the Overture Maps Data Repo
===
This repository includes instructions and sample queries to access Overture Maps Data.

We also welcome feedback about Overture Maps data in the [Discussions](https://github.com/OvertureMaps/data/discussions/new/choose). Feedback on the data *schema*, is best provided in the [discussions in the *schema* repository](https://github.com/OvertureMaps/schema/discussions).


Accessing Overture Maps Data
---

Overture Maps data is available in cloud-native [Parquet](https://parquet.apache.org/docs/) format.
There is no single Overture "entire planet" file to be downloaded. Instead, we
have organized the data for the `Overture 2023-07-26-alpha.0` release by theme and type at the following locations:

### Data Location

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Theme</th>
    <th>Location</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Admins</th>
    <td>
      <ul>

### Parquet Schema
The Parquet files match the [Overture Data Schema](https://docs.overturemaps.org/)
for each theme with the following enhancements:

1. The `id` column contains _temporary_ IDs that are not yet part of the [Global Entity Reference System (GERS)](https://docs.overturemaps.org/gers/).
   These IDs are not yet stable and are likely to change significantly up
   to the point that GERS is released.
2. The `bbox` column is a `struct` with the following attributes:
   `minX`, `maxX`, `minY`, `maxY`. This column allows you to craft more
   efficient spatial queries when running SQL against the cloud.
3. The `geometry` column is encoded as WKB.

## Accessing Overture Maps Data
You can access Overture Parquet data files directly from the cloud, or copy them
to your preferred destination, or download them locally. We do encourage you to
fetch the data directly from the cloud using one of the SQL query options
documented below.

### 1. Amazon Athena (SQL)
1. You will need an AWS account.
2. In the [Amazon Athena](https://aws.amazon.com/athena/) console on AWS:
   - Run `CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE` queries to set up your view of the tables: [click for queries](athena_setup_queries.sql).
   - Be sure to load the partitions by running `MSCK REPAIR <tablename>;` or choosing "Load Partitions" from the table options menu.

Example Athena SQL query to download a CSV of places in Seattle:

```sql
SELECT
       CAST(names AS JSON),
       geometry -- WKB
FROM
       places
WHERE
       bbox.minX > -122.4447744
   AND bbox.maxX < -122.2477071
   AND bbox.minY > 47.5621587
   AND bbox.maxY < 47.7120663
```

More information on using Athena is available in the [Amazon Athena User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/ug/what-is.html).

### 2. Microsoft Synapse (SQL)

1. You will need an Azure account.
2. Create a [Synapse workspace](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/synapse-analytics/get-started-create-workspace).

Example SQL query to read places in Seattle:

```sql
SELECT TOP 10 *
  FROM
       OPENROWSET(
           BULK 'https://overturemapswestus2.blob.core.windows.net/release/2023-07-26-alpha.0/theme=places/type=place/',
           FORMAT = 'PARQUET'
       )
  WITH
       (
           names VARCHAR(MAX),
           categories VARCHAR(MAX),
           websites VARCHAR(MAX),
           phones VARCHAR(MAX),
           bbox VARCHAR(200),
           geometry VARBINARY(MAX)
       )
    AS
       [result]
 WHERE
       TRY_CONVERT(FLOAT, JSON_VALUE(bbox, '$.minx')) > -122.4447744
   AND TRY_CONVERT(FLOAT, JSON_VALUE(bbox, '$.maxx')) < -122.2477071
   AND TRY_CONVERT(FLOAT, JSON_VALUE(bbox, '$.miny')) > 47.5621587
   AND TRY_CONVERT(FLOAT, JSON_VALUE(bbox, '$.maxy')) < 47.7120663
```

More information is available at [Query files using a serverless SQL pool - Training | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/query-data-lake-using-azure-synapse-serverless-sql-pools/3-query-files).

### 3. DuckDB (SQL)
[DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/) is an analytics tool you can install
locally that can efficiently query remote Parquet files using SQL. It
will only download the subset of files it needs to fulfil your queries.

If, for example, you wanted to download the administrative boundaries
for all `adminLevel=2` features, you could run:

```sql
COPY (
    SELECT
           type,
           subType,
           localityType,
           adminLevel,
           isoCountryCodeAlpha2,
           JSON(names) AS names,
           JSON(sources) AS sources,
           ST_GeomFromWKB(geometry) AS geometry
      FROM read_parquet('s3://overturemaps-us-west-2/release/2023-07-26-alpha.0/theme=admins/type=*/*', filename=true, hive_partitioning=1)
     WHERE adminLevel = 2
       AND ST_GeometryType(ST_GeomFromWKB(geometry)) IN ('POLYGON','MULTIPOLYGON')
) TO 'countries.geojson'
WITH (FORMAT GDAL, DRIVER 'GeoJSON');
```

This will create a `countries.geojson` file containing 265 country
polygons and multipolygons.

To make this query work in DuckDB, you may need a couple of one-time
setup items to install the [duckdb_spatial](https://github.com/duckdblabs/duckdb_spatial)
and [httpfs](https://duckdb.org/docs/guides/import/s3_import.html) extensions:

```sql
INSTALL spatial;
INSTALL httpfs;
```

And a couple of per-session items to load the extensions and tell DuckDB which
S3 region to find Overture's data bucket in:

```sql
LOAD spatial;
LOAD httpfs;
SET s3_region='us-west-2';
```

<!-- #### Jupyter Notebooks + DuckDB

**TODO: Link below doesn't exist yet. ðŸ‘‡**

### 4. Download the Parquet files
You can download the Parquet files from either Azure Blob Storage or Amazon S3 at the locations given in the table at the top of the page.

After installing the [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html),
you can download the files from S3 using the below command. Set `<DESTINATION>` to a local directory path to
download the files, or to an `s3://` path you control to copy them into your S3 bucket.
```bash
aws s3 cp --no-sign-request --recursive s3://overturemaps-us-west-2/release/2023-07-26-alpha.0/ <DESTINATION>
```

You can download the files from Azure Blob Storage using
[Azure Storage Explorer](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/storage/storage-explorer/)
or the [AzCopy](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-use-azcopy-v10?toc=%2Fazure%2Fstorage%2Fblobs%2Ftoc.json&bc=%2Fazure%2Fstorage%2Fblobs%2Fbreadcrumb%2Ftoc.json#download-azcopy)
command. An example `azcopy` command is given below.

```bash
azcopy copy "https://overturemapswestus2.dfs.core.windows.net/release/2023-07-26-alpha.0/" "<<local directory path>>"  --recursive```
```
