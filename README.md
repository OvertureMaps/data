### See complete instructions on accessing Overture data in **[our how-to pages](https://labs.overturemaps.org/how-to/accessing-data/)**. 

We welcome feedback about Overture Maps data in the [Discussions](https://github.com/OvertureMaps/data/discussions/new/choose). Feedback on the data *schema*, is best provided in the [discussions in the *schema* repository](https://github.com/OvertureMaps/schema/discussions).


Overture Maps Data
---
Overture Maps data is available in cloud-native [Parquet](https://parquet.apache.org/docs/) format.
There is no single Overture "entire planet" file to be downloaded. Instead, the data is partitioned by both `theme` and `type` and made available on Amazon S3 and Microsoft Azure Blob Storage. Read more about Overture themes at [docs.overturemaps.org](https://docs.overturemaps.org)

The latest release, `Overture 2024-03-12-alpha.0`, is available at the following locations: 

#### Amazon S3 
```
s3://overturemaps-us-west-2/release/2024-03-12-alpha.0/
  |-- theme=admins/
  |-- theme=base/
  |-- theme=buildings/
  |-- theme=places/
  |-- theme=transportation/
```

#### Microsft Azure
```
https://overturemapswestus2.blob.core.windows.net/release/2024-03-12-alpha.0/
 |- theme=admins
 |- theme=base
 |- theme=buildings
 |- theme=places
 |- theme=transportation
```

### Parquet Schema
The Parquet files match the [Overture Data Schema](https://docs.overturemaps.org/)
for each theme with the following enhancements:

1. The `id` column contains unique identifiers in the [Global Entity Reference System (GERS)](https://docs.overturemaps.org/gers/) format.
2. The `bbox` column is a `struct` with the following attributes:
   `minX`, `maxX`, `minY`, `maxY`. This column allows you to craft more
   efficient spatial queries when running SQL against the cloud.
3. The `geometry` column is encoded as WKB (the files are geoparquet).
